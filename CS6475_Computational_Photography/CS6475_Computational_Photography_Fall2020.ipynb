    "This class explores how computation impacts the entire workflow of photography, which is traditionally aimed at capturing light from a (3D) scene to form a (2D) image. A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely, the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images, is undertaken over the entire term. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making will be emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation. Topics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined. New forms of cameras and imaging paradigms will be introduced. Students will undertake a hands-on approach over the entire term using computation techniques, merged with digital imaging processes to produce photographic artifacts.\n",
